# String and Number Manipulation

## Simple Number Multiplication

Create a console application that, given a comma separated list of strings, prints the result of multiplying the values together. 

### Example:

`"1,2,3" --> 6`

`"2,4,5" --> 40`

## Number Squares

Add an option asking the user whether to multiply (previous case) or square the numbers being passed in.  If the user chooses square, each number in the list should be multiplied by itself and then returned as a comma separated list.  

### Example

`"1,2,3" --> "1,4,9"`

`"2,4,5" --> "4,16,25"`
